        <br>
        <p>Welcome to our <span>Budget Planner Website</span>, your trusted partner in personal financial planning and budgeting. We are dedicated to empowering individuals and families to take control of their finances through smart budgeting, financial literacy, and practical money management tools.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Understanding that humans don't always act rationally, we incorporate insights from behavioral economics—helping you overcome common financial biases like impulse spending, loss aversion, and present bias. Through subtle nudges, goal-setting, and visual feedback, we support smarter, more intentional money habits.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our platform is also inspired by practical budgeting systems such as Zero-Based Budgeting and the Envelope Method, which assign every dollar a job and allocate funds to specific categories—making financial planning both structured and flexible.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Whether you're working toward financial independence, paying off debt, or just trying to track your spending, [Your Website Name] offers more than a tool—we offer a theory-backed system that grows with you.</p>

        <h1>Our Mission/Purpose</h1>
        <hr style="width:500px">
        <br>
        <p>Our approach is grounded in key financial theories that shape how people manage money over time. We draw inspiration from the Life-Cycle Hypothesis, which suggests that people plan their consumption and savings behavior across different stages of life. By helping users anticipate future needs and prepare accordingly, we support a long-term, balanced financial lifestyle.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We also apply the Permanent Income Hypothesis, encouraging users to budget based on expected average income over time—not just current earnings. This helps prevent lifestyle inflation and promotes sustainable financial habits.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our purpose is to combine financial theory with real-life application, giving users a reliable framework to make informed decisions, develop healthy financial habits, and ultimately, achieve financial peace of mind.

            <p class="para">1. Life-Cycle Hypothesis (LCH)
                Theory by: Franco Modigliani and Richard Brumberg
                Core Idea:
                People aim to maintain a stable standard of living over their lifetime by saving during high-income periods (e.g., working years) and spending during low-income periods (e.g., retirement).
                
                Relation to Budgeting:
                Budget planners help users allocate income wisely over time, preparing for future needs (like retirement or education) while managing current expenses.
                <br><br>
                2. Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH)
                Theory by: Milton Friedman
                Core Idea:
                People base consumption on their expected long-term income rather than short-term income changes.
                
                Relation to Budgeting:
                A personal budget should reflect not just current earnings, but future expectations (e.g., promotions, career growth). This helps avoid overspending during income spikes or stress during temporary income drops.</p>
